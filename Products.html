New Orleans has a lot of different coffee companies these days, but Café du Monde's specialty chicory roasts are one of the originals. The beignet stand has been around since 1862, with coffees available nationwide for a good portion of that long history. Despite such a storied past, Café du Monde coffee requires a particular type of taste bud to be truly appreciated.
